                    <p >
                    I create Mobile Apps from scratch, I design the UX and build
                     and implement the back-end from the ground up. Through this experience, I have gained expertise in 
                     transforming early stage ideas into production grade applications. These projects are cross-platform and work on
                      a variety of platforms including IOS, Android and the Web.

                    <b> Experience In Creating End To End Deep Learning Apps</b>
                    <p >
                    I am familiar with a selection of Python's Deep Learning and Machine learning libaries, recently I used
                    fast.ai to create PyTorch models which I integrated with a ReactJS front-end.
                    Through this process, I have gained a good understanding of what its like to work with the data pipeline across
                     the front and back-end.

                    <b> Commercial Awareness</b>
                    <p >
                    My First-Class Honours in Economics and time working in Finance/Business development has given me a well-rounded view of all stake holders involved in IT projects.
                    I have managed multiple cybersecurity projects simultaneously to deliver value proposition and ROI to executive leadership for purchasing Darktrace. 
                    Through this experience I furthered my communication  skills âˆ’ Maintaining strong relationships between clients, partners, and the software engineering and operations teams to ensure the best
                    outcome for the customer and business.
